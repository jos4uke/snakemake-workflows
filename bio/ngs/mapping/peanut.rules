"""
Read mapping with PEANUT (http://peanut.readthedocs.org).

Expects a global variable CONFIG (e.g. parsed from json) of at least the
following structure, assuming that the desired reference sequence is some genome
to be found under the given path, and two units A and B have been sequenced with Illumina, 
the first paired and the second single end:

{
    "references": {
        "genome": "path/to/genome.fasta"
    }
    "samples": {
        "A": ["A"],
        "B": ["B"]
    }
    "units": {
        "A":
            ["path/to/A_R1.fastq.gz", "path/to/A_R2.fastq.gz"],
        "B":
            ["path/to/B.fastq.gz"]
    }
    "platform": "Illumina"
}

Note the separation between samples and units that allows to have more than
one sequencing run for each sample, or multiple lanes per sample.
